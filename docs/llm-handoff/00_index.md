# 00 - Index for the LLM handoff packet

This folder is the ordered design handoff for rebuilding the flattened cube experience from the ground up.

Read the files in numeric order. Each file is written for an LLM-assisted implementation workflow where the human developer is a professional mathematician and lower-intermediate programmer. The instructions are intentionally concrete, but they are still scaffolding instructions rather than a final implementation spec.

## Ordered files

## Core design correction

The software is not a theorem tutor. It should provide a reliable explorable environment.

Do not build a theorem engine. Do not compute curvature effects. Do not compute Gauss-Bonnet, holonomy values, Euler characteristic, or point-to-point geodesics as part of the first implementation. Those ideas may be discovered by students using the environment, physical discussion, instructor guidance, and later optional tools.

The first mathematical tool is a locally straight ray tool: aim, shoot, cross portals by rigid transforms, stop at a wall, forbidden zone, maximum distance, or maximum portal count.

## First implemented world model

The runtime should be 3D-cell aware from the beginning, but the first implemented cell type is a vertical prism over a 2D polygonal base.

A prism cell has:

- a floor,
- a ceiling,
- vertical side faces,
- ordinary walls on non-portal side faces,
- portal faces on selected side faces,
- decorations and markers placed in local cell coordinates.

The floor and ceiling are ordinary collision surfaces and have no portals in the first implementation.

## Absolute rule about singular-looking places

A player or placed tool must never intersect the forbidden zone or object
clearance around a portal junction.

A portal junction is a codimension-2 place where two or more portal faces meet. In a prism cell, this is usually a vertical edge where two portal walls meet. The code should treat this as a movement/collision safety rule, not as a curvature calculation.
