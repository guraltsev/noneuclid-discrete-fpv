# 06 - Authoring model

## Current authoring format

Use TypeScript world specs first.

Do not start with JSON schema, visual editors, QR scanning, or a custom DSL. Those are authoring inputs for later. The first goal is to stabilize the runtime contract.

World specs should be ordinary TypeScript values:

```ts
export const twoPrismLoop: CellComplexSpec = {
  id: "two-prism-loop",
  title: "Two Prism Loop",
  start: {
    cell: "room-a",
    position: [0, 0, 1.45],
    yawDegrees: 0,
  },
  cells: [
    {
      kind: "prism",
      id: "room-a",
      base: squareBase(4),
      height: 3,
      sideFaces: [
        { edge: "north", kind: "portal", portal: "a-north" },
        { edge: "east", kind: "wall" },
        { edge: "south", kind: "wall" },
        { edge: "west", kind: "wall" }
      ],
      decorations: []
    }
  ],
  portals: [
    {
      id: "a-north",
      from: { cell: "room-a", face: "north" },
      to: { cell: "room-b", face: "south" },
      orientation: { turnDegrees: 0 }
    }
  ]
};
```

This example is illustrative, not final API. The exact spec shape should be stabilized during stage 2.

## Authoring priorities

A world author should be able to read one file and understand:

- what cells exist,
- what shape each cell is,
- which side faces are walls,
- which side faces are portals,
- how portals connect,
- where the player starts,
- which tools are enabled,
- what decorations are present.

Avoid hidden defaults for mathematically meaningful choices. Defaults are acceptable for visual style, lighting, and decoration scale.

## Portal authoring

In the first implementation, portal authoring should avoid arbitrary matrices.

Prefer restricted descriptions:

```ts
orientation: { turnDegrees: 0 | 90 | 180 | 270 | -90 }
```

or a named frame match:

```ts
match: "same-up" | "half-turn" | "quarter-turn-left" | "quarter-turn-right"
```

The compiler should compute the rigid transform and reject impossible glueings.

An expert matrix escape hatch can be added later, but it should not be the normal path.

## Future compiler step

Later authoring inputs should compile into the same checked `CellComplexSpec` or a closely related JSON-compatible intermediate format.

Future pipeline:

```text
TypeScript spec
       or
JSON spec
       or
visual authoring app output
       or
QR marker scan output
  -> authoring validation
  -> CellComplexSpec
  -> compileCellComplex(...)
  -> CompiledCellComplex
```

The runtime must not care which authoring input produced the spec.

## Future QR marker authoring

The QR idea should be a separate authoring app, not part of the VR runtime.

Possible workflow:

1. Print face cards or edge cards with QR codes.
2. Each QR code encodes a world id, face id, edge id, and orientation marker.
3. The authoring app scans two compatible edge markers.
4. The app records a portal glueing proposal.
5. The app exports JSON.
6. The regular authoring validator checks the JSON.
7. The regular cell-complex compiler builds the runtime world.

A QR code should identify an authoring object. It should not contain arbitrary executable logic.

## What not to do now

Do not implement the QR app in the first implementation.

Do not add camera permissions to the VR app for QR scanning.

Do not create a full visual editor before the runtime works.

Do not support arbitrary malformed glueings in the name of flexibility. The compiler should reject unclear data loudly.
