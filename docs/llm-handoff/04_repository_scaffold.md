# 04 - Repository scaffold

## Top-level shape

Use a single Vite TypeScript project.

Do not create a monorepo for the first implementation. The proof of concept had package boundaries, but the ground-up rebuild should avoid package overhead until the architecture proves it needs it.

Target structure:

## Import direction

Use this dependency direction:

```text
math
  -> no project imports

cell-complex
  -> math

movement
  -> math + cell-complex

tools
  -> math + cell-complex + movement public types

render/three
  -> math + cell-complex + movement + tools public outputs

classroom
  -> public app/tool state only

authoring
  -> cell-complex specs and validation

glue
  -> browser APIs, storage, URLs, deployment-specific helpers
```

Do not let `math`, `cell-complex`, `movement`, or `tools` import from `render`.

Do not let renderer code become the source of truth for portals, collision, movement, forbidden zones, or ray behavior.

## Public modules versus glue modules

Mathematically and physically meaningful code belongs in:

```text
src/math/
src/cell-complex/
src/movement/
src/tools/
```

Skippable glue belongs in:

```text
src/render/three/
src/glue/
src/classroom/
```

A future reader should be able to audit the world rules without opening `src/render/three`.

## Naming conventions

Prefer files named after public behavior:

```text
compileCellComplex.ts
movePlayer.ts
traceStraightRay.ts
buildCellMesh.ts
```

Avoid generic containers:

```text
engine.ts
manager.ts
system.ts
services.ts
utils.ts
helpers.ts
```

A file named `utils.ts` is allowed only as a temporary placeholder during the first pass, and it must be split during the cleanup pass.

## One app entrypoint

`src/main.ts` should stay small.

It should:

1. select a world spec,
2. compile it,
3. create initial app state,
4. create the Three app,
5. connect controls/tools/debug UI.

It should not contain compiler logic, collision logic, ray logic, or portal math.

## Decision records

Use tiny private decision notes when a choice could otherwise be relitigated by future LLM sessions.

Examples:

```text
docs/decisions/001-stack.md
docs/decisions/002-prism-cells-first.md
docs/decisions/003-no-curvature-engine.md
```

Each decision note should answer:

- What did we decide?
- Why now?
- What are we explicitly not deciding?
- What would cause us to revisit this?

Do not create a documentation site.
