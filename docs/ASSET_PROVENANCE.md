# Third-party asset provenance and notices

This is the canonical asset manifest for NonEuclidean FPV. It covers every
third-party file presently under `public/assets`, which Vite copies into a
site build. The project [MIT License](../LICENSE) applies only to
project-authored source and documentation; it does **not** change the terms of
any item below.

## How to read this record

- **Runtime** means the current application requests the item. **Public only**
  means Vite currently deploys it even though the app does not request it.
- **Source-only** files are kept for authoring or rebuilding, not for browser
  loading. They remain accidentally public until
  [issue 34](issues/34_reduce_deployment_and_repository_asset_footprint.md)
  completes the source/runtime split.
- The repository did not preserve original download dates, checksums, or an
  upstream version number. The sources and local license records below were
  reconciled on 2026-08-03. Do not claim a more exact version than the source
  page records.
- **Blocked** is a release gate, not a license. It means the asset must not be
  used in a new deployment or redistributed separately until
  [issue 40](issues/40_resolve_unverified_public_assets.md) resolves it.

When an asset moves, update its path in this file in the same change. Keep this
record and any required local license text with the asset; generated KTX2 files
remain derivatives of their listed source material.

The first four Quaternius and iPoly3D entries above correct earlier local
records that named a creator but omitted the page’s CC0 grant. The local
`license.txt` files remain with the files as convenient credit copies.

## Legacy Sketchfab models

These assets are currently public. The following are runtime-distributed by
some example worlds: `clock_low_poly`, `low_poly_campfire`, `low_poly_rocks`,
`low_poly_emergency_button`, and `racoon-animation`; the others are public
only. Each folder’s `license.txt` preserves the source’s required wording.

## Floor textures

`runtime/*.ktx2` is runtime-distributed. The rest of each texture folder is
source-only authoring material, although it is temporarily public because of
the issue 34 packaging defect. The KTX2 output is generated from the listed
color/diffuse map and inherits its source asset’s license.

## Blocked, unverified, or incorrect historical records

Do **not** infer a license from a filename, a host site, or a nearby asset. The
following files have no sufficient provenance in this repository. They are
listed here to make the problem visible and are governed by issue 40. They must
be removed from a release, replaced with documented material, or have their
original acquisition record verified before reuse.

The abstract image is currently requested for portal walls. | Public; portal-wall use is blocked and must be replaced or verified. |

## Adding an asset

Before committing an asset, record its exact path, original work title,
creator, source URL, license URL/version, required credit, acquisition/version
information, and whether it is source-only or runtime-distributed. Keep
required license and notice text with redistributable binaries. Do not add a
file to `public/` until this record is complete.

For icon discovery, [SVG Repo’s ruler collection](https://www.svgrepo.com/vectors/ruler/)
is another useful source of SVG candidates. It hosts icons from multiple
creators and licenses, so record the individual icon page and its actual terms;
do not treat the collection page as a single license grant.

For low-poly 3D models, [Poly Pizza](https://poly.pizza/) is another useful
source. Record the individual model page, creator, license version, and any
required credit; models on the site do not all share one attribution rule.

[UXWing](https://uxwing.com/) is another good SVG icon source. Its license does
not require credit for allowed use, but record the exact icon URL and its
terms. Do not copy UXWing files into a separately redistributable icon library,
because its terms prohibit redistribution and sublicensing.
